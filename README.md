## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 🧠 How It's Built

#### 🌐 Frontend

- The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with **React.js**.
- I used **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and HMR.
- **React Router DOM** is used for navigating between views like Home, Browse Lawyers, and User Dashboard.
- **Axios** handles HTTP requests, all centralized inside a `service` file for clean code.
- Styling is done using **CSS Modules**, allowing scoped styles and modular design.
- I added **react-hot-toast** for elegant toast notifications and **react-confirm-alert** for confirmation dialogs to improve UX.

#### 🔧 Backend

- Built with **Java** and the **Spring Boot** framework.
- **Spring Web** was used to build RESTful APIs for lawyers and user legal requests (CRUD operations).
- **Spring Data JPA** with Hibernate manages database persistence through entities (`Lawyer`, `Request`) instead of raw SQL.
- I configured **CORS globally** to enable secure communication between React (port 5173) and Spring Boot (port 8080).
- **Maven** handles project dependencies and packaging.

#### 🛢️ Database

- The app uses **MySQL** for storing lawyer data and legal requests.
- Hibernate is configured to automatically update or generate tables from the Java entities, reducing the need for manual SQL.

---

## 🔍 Key Challenges & Learning Points

- **CORS Setup**: One of the most critical challenges was setting up CORS for smooth frontend-backend communication. I used browser dev tools and backend logs to debug and resolve cross-origin request issues.
- **ID Generation Strategy**: Initially, the ID counter was shared between multiple entities. I later implemented `@TableGenerator` to give each table its own ID sequence, keeping the schema clean and consistent.
- **CRUD Mastery**: Managing the end-to-end flow for all CRUD operations deepened my understanding of full-stack dev. The delete operation, for example, required coordination across React (event handler), Axios (API call), Spring (endpoint), and database (delete logic).

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**: Add login/signup using **Spring Security + JWT** to secure user and lawyer accounts.
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Lawyer Profiles**: Let lawyers showcase experience, education, and profile images.
- 💬 **In-App Messaging**: Enable direct, secure chat between lawyers and users via WebSocket.
- ⭐ **Ratings & Reviews**: Allow users to leave feedback for lawyers they’ve worked with.
- 📍 **Google Maps Integration**: Show lawyer location on a map for nearby help.
- 📁 **Document Uploads**: Enable users to attach images or files for legal documents.
